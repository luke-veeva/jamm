Overview
========

Jamm provides `MemoryMeter`, a Java agent for all Java versions to
measure actual object memory use including JVM overhead.


Use
===

To use `MemoryMeter`, start the JVM with `-javaagent:<path to>/jamm.jar`.

You can then use MemoryMeter in your code like this:

    MemoryMeter meter = MemoryMeter.builder().build();
    meter.measure(object);
    meter.measureDeep(object);

See [`MemoryMeter.Builder`](./src/org/github/jamm/MemoryMeter.java) for more
options.

If you would like to use `MemoryMeter` in a web application, make sure
that you do NOT put this jar in `WEB-INF/lib`, as that may cause problems
since your code is accessing a MemoryMeter from a different class loader
than the one loaded by the `-javaagent` and won't see it as initialized.

If you want `MemoryMeter` not to measure some specific classes, you can
mark the classes (or interfaces) using the
[`@Unmetered`](./src/org/github/jamm/Unmetered.java) annotation.

It is good to reuse existing `MemoryMeter` instances. Creating new `MemoryMeter`
instances can and will cause significant performance penalties and also
unnecessary side effects, since all guess-modes rely on `java.lang.ClassValue`.


Dependency coordinates for the latest version of Jamm
=====================================================

Gradle:

    dependencies {
        implementation("io.github.stephankoelle:jamm:0.4.1")
    }

The fine print
==============

`MemoryMeter` can use
`java.lang.instrument.Instrumentation.getObjectSize()`, which only claims
to provide "approximate" results, but in practice seems to work as
expected.

Two more implementations are available as well. One is using
`sun.misc.Unsafe` w/ reflection and one just uses reflection. Both are
inaccurate and rely on guesses. It is strongly recommended to *not
use* "unsafe" or "specification" and jamm will emit a warning on
stderr:
* The "Unsafe" implementation performs arithmetics on the "cookies"
  returned by `Unsafe.objectFieldOffset()`, althought the Javadoc says:
  `Do not expect to perform any sort of arithmetic on this offset;
  it is just a cookie which is passed to the unsafe heap memory accessors.`
  The implementation does not always consider Java object layouts in under
  all circumstances for all JVMs.
* The "specification" is just a best-effort guess-timate that can
  easily produce results that are wrong w/ newer JVMs and GCs and/or
  newer Java features.

0.4.0 notes
===========

* The method `MemoryMeter.countChildren()` has been removed, because
  there is a) no corresponding implementation from JDK-8249196 and
  b) there was no test coverage at all.
* The construction of the `MemoryMeter` instance has been refactored
  to a proper builder pattern to allow distinct classes for each
  implementation: Instrumentation, Unsafe, Specification).
* A bunch of internal optimizations went into the existing guess-modes
  and performance for these modes has also been _significantly_
  improved (about 10x, see microbenchmark results above).
* Support for `@Unmetered` for fields has been removed for the future
  implementation of `java.lang.Runtime.deepSizeOf()` with Java 16.
